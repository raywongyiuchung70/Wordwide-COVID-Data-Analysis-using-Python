# Wordwide-COVID-Data-Analysis-using-Python
**1. Project Background**

During the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic, an accurate and timely health data
analysis became critical. ABC Health Analytics company was asked to initiate a project to
visualize and analysis both the health data for the globe and the individual continents /
countries comprehensively and timely. The aims of the data visualization and analysis is
to enable the respective authorities, utilizing these data as an input, to response with
concreate and necessary actions timely, so as to improve the situations and help the
publics. The reviews of the data analytics and visualization from the respective
authorities after the whole pandemic was ended will also enable the post-mortem
analysis to the whole global healthcare disasters such that policies dealing with future
pandemics can be improved and optimized . The underling tools chosen for the analysis
are the Python Libraries such as Pandas, Mataplotlib and seaborn. The data used for the
analysis was came from “Our World in Data” which include the necessary information for
COVID-19 metrics across all countries. Tables and Graphs breakdown to different
categories, countries, times was pulled out from the datasets using the above Python
Libraries for analysis and conclusions.

**2. Project Objective**

1. Demonstrate the ability of import large scale datasets to the Python environments
for explorations using for appropriate libraries.
2. Demonstrate the ability to perform the Data Cleaning and Featuring Engineering to
the datasets for further analysis.
3. Performed a Worldwide Overview of the COVID-19 and the Regional analysis on the
cleaned data .
4. Performed a Time Series Analysis on the Datasets by capturing the daily dynamics
of the COVID-19 in the global level.
5. Provide an in-depth analysis for the COVID-19 datasets for the selected countries.
6. Derived insights from the datasets through visualization through external factors

The Visualization of the datasets was done by importing the datasets in the Goggle
Colab Python environments, applying the appropriate Python Libraries under Pandas,
Matplotlib & seaborn to cleans and feature engineered the datasets and eventually
plotting appropriate tables and graphs using the abovementioned libraries.
Appropriate insights are finally derived from the visualizations for the reviews.
Insights will be drawn from the data analytics for future improvement purposes
